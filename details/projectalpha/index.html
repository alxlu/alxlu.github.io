      <p>Project Alpha is an RTS game in its early stages of development using the Unity3d game engine. Due to the speed at
        which we are working, the video above is lacking in certain features that have since been added afterwards. We are
        currently looking to add a few new members to our team. If you are interested in working with us, please visit
        <a href="/join.html">projectalpha.me/join</a> for more information.</p>
      <br>
      <h1>Progress</h1>
      <p>Currently a lot of the basic groundwork has been completed. Our own version of lockstep networking has also been implemented,
        so the game should be able to handle a large number of units. Deterministic flocking and collisions are still lacking,
        however (as is evident in the demo video).</p>
      <p>We have almost completely finished the creation of one of our creeps, and a hero unit is coming along quickly. Once
        they are completely finished and we have a consistent pipeline for their creation, the rest should be produced more
        efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>Below is an interactive turntable of the first creep we have created: the Gorilla Yeti. Click and drag on top of the
        image to rotate.</p>

      <p>The model is very light, consisting of only around 300 triangles. Most of the detail was added on via a very high-poly
        sculpt in Z-Brush which was then baked onto the original model (note that in the above turntable, only about half
        of the model has the detailed texture applied so far).</p>

      <p>Inside the game, the normal map is applied from the high poly model, so the character can be lit dynamically. There
        is also a shader applied to it that simulates rim lighting.</p>

      <p>Here is how our UI will look (click to enlarge). Currently it isn't hooked up to anything.</p>

      <h1>Concept</h1>
      <p>The concept behind Project Alpha is to create a solid RTS gaming experience while adding on our own unique, creative
        twist to the genre. So far, our idea involves adding elements from other genres such as central hero units that can
        gain new abilities and level up from MOBA games and being able to assimilate attributes from other characters like
        in Spore.</p>
      <p>Our art style will be decidedly whimsical as shown in the concept art below</p>
