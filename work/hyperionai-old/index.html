<p>Hyperion.ai is the product of a startup I am currently the co-founder and CEO
of. It is a custom multivitamin that improves itself over time by using
artificial intelligence to continuously monitor and analyze a user's health
data. This writeup will be focused primarily on the business, technology, and
other behind the scenes aspects of Hyperion.ai. For more information about the
product itself, check out: <a href="http://hyperion.ai">http://hyperion.ai</a></p>

<h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Overview</h2>
<p>People come in all different shapes and sizes. So, it’s no surprise that we all have unique nutritional needs. The nutritional supplement industry has capitalized on this problem, but we feel that current solutions leave a lot to be desired. Today, when consumers shop for vitamins-whether from a local drugstore or online-they are bombarded with tons of options. How are they supposed to know which product meets their needs? And perhaps more importantly, how are they supposed to know if said product provides a tangible improvement to their quality of life? That’s where we come in.</p>
<p>Hyperion AI provides a completely free app that collects a user’s health data. The app allows users to track any metric they’d like. Additionally, users can connect fitness integrations such as HealthKit and Fitbit. We then visualize these metrics so that the user can see their progress over time. On top of that, we also normalize the data, allowing users to compare different metric against one another. For example, a user might wonder if their overall energy levels correlate with the amount of water they drink. With Hyperion AI, it’s only a few taps away. Finally, Hyperion AI will use artificial intelligence to continuously process the user’s health data, allowing us to find potentially significant correlations between tracked metrics. If the user is subscribed to one of our monthly supplement plans, the AI will also construct and continuously refine a unique, custom supplement tailored for each user, which will ship on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>We believe that by eliminating the financial barrier to entry, our free app gives us a huge edge against our competitors, building a relationship of trust with our users before they give us a dime.</p>

<h2 id="progress"><a href="#progress" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Progress</h2>
<h3 id="app"><a href="#app" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>App</h3>
<p>We currently have a functioning prototype of the app on TestFlight. We are
planning to have a beta out on the iOS app store within the next few months.
While the app is currently not in app stores yet, I have
a recording here of our prototype in action:</p>
<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kV4bO9HSraI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
<p>And if you are interested in trying out the app yourself (iOS only at the moment—support for other platforms planned),
please don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
<h3 id="physical-supplement"><a href="#physical-supplement" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Physical Supplement</h3>
<p>We also have a rough prototype of the physical supplement itself. While we are currently capable of creating the pills, we will
need a cGMP compliant facility to produce them before we can legally distribute them per FDA regulations. Currently, the supplements
are being hand produced, but we hope to automate as much of this process as possible in the future.</p>

<h3 id="app--web-ui"><a href="#app--web-ui" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>App &#x26; Web UI</h3>
<p>Hyperion.ai is a React Native App. And the Web UI is written
using React. For both platforms we use Redux to manage state and Redux-Saga
for side effects (e.g. API calls). This allows us to share a lot of the
business logic despite the differences between React Native and React (web)
components. Additionally, we also use the iOS WebView element to display
several views in our app. This allows us to develop the mobile site and iOS
app simultaneously while giving us the option to implement the view
natively. So far, despite HTML5-based apps reputation for being less
performant than native, the difference in performance for our app is
imperceptible. I believe this is due to a combination of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved browser rendering engines</li>
<li>The nature of our app (e.g. we don't need to perform any expensive animations)</li>
<li>Improved hardware</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, I only use React Native views primarily to provide a more native-like experience. For instance,
the ability to swipe to go back to a previous page is something easily done using React Native, but is difficult
(and likely less performant using HTML5).</p>
<div class="spacer" />
<h3 id="service"><a href="#service" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Service</h3>
<p>The Hyperion.ai backend is written using Node.js and the database is hosted using
PostgreSQL. For the backend, I decided to leverage several services to help speed up
development and potentially reduce headaches down the line—particularly regarding
security. We are using Heroku to host the service.</p>

<div class="spacer" />
<h3 id="tooling--deployment"><a href="#tooling--deployment" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Tooling &#x26; Deployment</h3>
<p>I set up Jenkins to handle running out automated tests and deployment. Whenever a change is made to the Deployment
branch in either of the projects, Jenkins will run all our automated tests and if they pass, it will deploy them to
production (AWS for the frontend, Heroku for the backend).</p>

<h3 id="coming-soon"><a href="#coming-soon" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Coming Soon!</h3>
<p>Since Hyperion Industries is completely bootstrapped, I had to create our video
on a shoestring budget. That meant that the motion graphics, video editing, and
overall branding had to be done by myself. If you'd like to learn more, feel
