My name is Alex Lu and I graduated\nfrom UCLA with a BA in Design Media Arts in 2014. Over the last few years, I've\nbeen fortunate enough to have been able to develop my skillset at a very diverse\nset of places. While in school, I interned at Pixar Animation Studios, NASA Jet\nPropulsion Lab, and Mirada Studios. Upon graduation I worked at Microsoft as a\nProgram Manager. Most recently, I've been working on a startup with two other\ncofounders. I've included writeups for some of the work I've done in the past.\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out!</p>\n<div class=\"spacer\" />\n<h1 id=\"contact\"><a href=\"#contact\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Contact</h1>\n<p>Email:  alex.lu [at] ucla.edu</p>\n<p>GitHub:</p>\n<p>LinkedIn:</p>\n<p>Demo Reel (Warning: old):</p>\n","__filename":"about.md","__url":"/about/","__resourceUrl":"/about/index.html","__dataUrl":"/about/index.html.6ea9eb0e1081b418ea0de0737f6417ec.json"}
