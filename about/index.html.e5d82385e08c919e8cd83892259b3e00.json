My name is Alex Lu and I graduated\nfrom UCLA with a BA in Design Media Arts in 2014. Over the last few years, I've\nbeen fortunate enough to have been able to develop my skillset at a very diverse\nset of places. While in school, I interned at Pixar Animation Studios, NASA Jet\nPropulsion Lab, and Mirada Studios. Upon graduation I worked at Microsoft as a\nProgram Manager. Most recently, I've been working on a startup with two other\ncofounders. I've included writeups for some of the work I've done in the past.\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out!</p>\n<h4 id=\"resume\"><a href=\"#resume\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bh3gxvupm17j54y/AlexLu_Resume2016.pdf?dl=1\">Resume</a></strong></h4>\n<div class=\"spacer\" />\n<h1 id=\"contact\"><a href=\"#contact\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Contact</h1>\n<p><strong>Email:</strong>  alex.lu [at] ucla.edu</p>\n<p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/alxlu\">https://github.com/alxlu</a></p>\n<p><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/alxlu\">https://linkedin.com/in/alxlu</a></p>\n<p><strong>Demo Reel (Warning: old):</strong> <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/61950083\">https://vimeo.com/61950083</a></p>\n","__filename":"about.md","__url":"/about/","__resourceUrl":"/about/index.html","__dataUrl":"/about/index.html.e5d82385e08c919e8cd83892259b3e00.json"}
