You can think of it like video game matchmaking, but in real life. For instance, if you are new to a city or just want to meet someone new, and decide that you would like to go get dinner within the next 3 hours, just log on to the website, specify what you would like to do and you will be matched with someone looking to do the same.</p>\n<div class=\"spacer\" />\n<h2 id=\"usage\"><a href=\"#usage\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Usage</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/meetup01.png\" alt=\"Meetup Screen\">\nUsers can sign up and upload their own images.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/meetup02.gif\" alt=\"Meetup Screen\">\nThe site will automatically scale the image and mask it into a circle.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/meetup03.png\" alt=\"Meetup Screen\">\nNext, the user will be asked to specify their location.
